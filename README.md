# Teixido-Quantum-Interconnects
Teixido-Quantum applies the principles of Topological Analytical Homeostasis (TAH) to the physical routing of quantum information. By replacing standard nearest-neighbor "Grid" coupling maps with High-Spectral-Gap Expander Graphs, we minimize the SWAP overhead required for complex algorithms.
